random numbers: 
- rand()
- <cstdlib> library for rand() and srand()
- use srand(time(0)); before rand function
- include <ctime> library for time function

mathematical functions:
- header file is <cmath>
- 
Stack- bottom to top buckets, last in, first out: any activity in an array will be performed as a stack
Variable of an array will store the value in the first bucket. If you wish to pass the entire array, must pass it as a pointer.
Use new to create an array that can be used outside of the function (heap- perisistent, will stay in memory)
C++ will create a default constructor and destructor. If not defined, it still runs, but there's nothing there so nothing happens.
